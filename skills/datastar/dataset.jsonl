{"instruction": "What is 'CQRS [#](#cqrs)' in the context of Datastar the tao of datastar?", "output": "[CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), in which commands (writes) and requests (reads) are segregated, makes it possible to have a single long-lived request to receive updates from the backend (reads), while making multiple short-lived requests to the backend (writes). It is a powerful pattern that makes real-time collaboration simple using Datastar. Here’s a basic example.\n```\n<div id=\"main\" data-init=\"@get('/cqrs_endpoint')\">\n    <button data-on:click=\"@post('/do_something')\">\n        Do something\n    </button>\n</div>\n```", "category": "concept"}

Here’s an example.\n```\n<div>\n    <button data-on:click=\"el.classList.add('loading'); @post('/do_something')\">\n        Do something\n        <span>Loading...</span>\n    </button>\n</div>\n```", "category": "concept"}

This means that JavaScript can be used in Datastar expressions.\n```\n<div data-text=\"$foo.length\"></div>\n```\n\nJavaScript operators are also available in Datastar expressions. This includes (but is not limited to) the ternary operator `?:`, the logical OR operator `||`, and the logical AND operator `&&`.

In the example below, `$fooBar` becomes `[\"fizz\", \"baz\"]` when both checkboxes are checked, and `[\"\", \"\"]` when neither is checked.\n```\n<div data-signals:foo-bar=\"[]\">\n    <input data-bind:foo-bar type=\"checkbox\" value=\"fizz\" />\n    <input data-bind:foo-bar type=\"checkbox\" value=\"baz\" />\n</div>\n```", "category": "reference"}

When Datastar processes these attributes, hyphenated names are automatically converted to [camel case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Camel_case) by removing hyphens and uppercasing the letter following each hyphen.\n\nDatastar handles casing of data attribute key suffixes containing hyphens in two ways:\n- The keys used in attributes that define signals (`data-bind:*`, `data-signals:*`, `data-computed:*`, etc.), are converted to camel case (the recommended casing for signals) by removing hyphens and uppercasing the letter following each hyphen. For example, `data-signals:my-signal` defines a signal named `mySignal`, and you would use the signal in a [Datastar expression](/guide/datastar_expressions) as `$mySignal`.\n- The keys suffixes used by all other attributes are, by default, converted to [kebab case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case). For example, `data-class:text-blue-700` adds or removes the class `text-blue-700`, and `data-on:rocket-launched` would react to the event named `rocket-launched`.\n\nYou can use the `__case` modifier to convert between `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, and `PascalCase`, or alternatively use object syntax when available.\n\nFor example, if listening for an event called `widgetLoaded`, you would use `data-on:widget-loaded__case.camel`.", "category": "reference"}

{"instruction": "How does 'Options [#](#options)' work in Datastar actions?", "output": "All of the actions above take a second argument of options.\n- `contentType` – The type of content to send. A value of `json` sends all signals in a JSON request. A value of `form` tells the action to look for the closest form to the element on which it is placed (unless a `selector` option is provided), perform validation on the form elements, and send them to the backend using a form request (no signals are sent). Defaults to `json`.\n- `filterSignals` – A filter object with an `include` property that accepts a regular expression to match signal paths (defaults to all signals: `/.*/`), and an optional `exclude` property to exclude specific signal paths (defaults to all signals that do not have a `_` prefix: `/(^_|\\._).*/`).\n> The [Datastar Inspector](/datastar_pro#datastar-inspector) can be used to inspect and filter current signals and view signal patch events in real-time.\n- `selector` – Optionally specifies a form to send when the `contentType` option is set to `form`. If the value is `null`, the closest form is used. Defaults to `null`.\n- `headers` – An object containing headers to send with the request.\n- `openWhenHidden` – Whether to keep the connection open when the page is hidden. Useful for dashboards but can cause a drain on battery life and other resources when enabled. Defaults to `false` for `get` requests, and `true` for all other HTTP methods.\n- `payload` – Allows the fetch payload to be overridden with a custom object.\n- `retry` – Determines when to retry requests. Can be `'auto'` (default, retries on network errors only), `'error'` (retries on `4xx` and `5xx` responses), `'always'` (retries on all non-`204` responses except redirects), or `'never'` (disables retries). Defaults to `'auto'`.\n- `retryInterval` – The retry interval in milliseconds. Defaults to `1000` (one second).\n- `retryScaler` – A numeric multiplier applied to scale retry wait times. Defaults to `2`.\n- `retryMaxWaitMs` – The maximum allowable wait time in milliseconds between retries", "category": "reference"}

{"instruction": "How does 'Optimistic UI [#](#optimistic-ui)' work in Datastar rocket?", "output": "Rocket pairs seamlessly with Datastar’s server-driven model to provide instant visual feedback without shifting ownership of state to the browser. In the [Rocket flow example](/examples/rocket_flow), dragging a node instantly renders its optimistic position in the SVG while the original light-DOM host remains hidden. The component adds an `.is-pending` class to dim the node and connected edges, signaling that the drag is provisional. Once the backend confirms the new coordinates and updates the layout, the component automatically clears the pending style.\n\nA dedicated prop such as `server-update-time=\"date\"` makes this straightforward: each tab receives an updated timestamp from the server (via SSE or a patch), Rocket decodes it into a `Date` (defaulting to the current time when no value is provided), and internal effects react to reconcile every view. Unlike client-owned graph editors (e.g. React Flow), the server stays the single source of truth, while the optimistic UI remains a thin layer inside the component.", "category": "reference"}

This is because, as an XML dialect, SVG is [namespaced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Namespaces_crash_course). This means that `[<svg>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg)` elements (as well as `[<math>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/math)` elements) create their own namespace, separate from the HTML namespace. \n\nTo morph an SVG element, you must either provide a `namespace` data line in the [`datastar-patch-elements`](/reference/sse_events#datastar-patch-elements) event:\n```\nevent: datastar-patch-elements\ndata: namespace svg\ndata: elements <circle id=\"circle\" cx=\"100\" r=\"50\" cy=\"75\"></circle>\n\n\n```\n \n\nOr, alternatively, ensure that the target element is wrapped in an `<svg>` tag:\n```\n<svg id=\"circle\">\n    <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"100\" r=\"50\" fill=\"red\" />\n</svg>\n```\n \n## Basic Circle Color Change [#](#basic-circle-color-change)\n \n\nThis example demonstrates morphing an SVG circle’s color. Click the button to change  the circle from red to blue.DemoChange Color \n```\nsvgMorphingRouter.Get(\"/circle_color\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    sse := datastar.NewSSE(w, r)\n    color := svgColors[rand.N(len(svgColors))]\n    sse.PatchElements(fmt.Sprintf(`<svg id=\"circle-demo\"><circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" fill=\"%s\" /></svg>`, color))\n})\n```\n \n## Circle Radius Change [#](#circle-radius-change)\n \n\nThis example shows how to morph the size of an SVG element.

Normally, the web component would output the reversed value, but in this example, all it does is perform the logic and dispatch an event containing the result, which is then displayed.\n```\n<label>\n    Reversed\n    <input type=\"text\" value=\"Your Name\" data-bind:_name/>\n</label>\n<span data-signals:_reversed data-text=\"$_reversed\"></span>\n<reverse-component\n    data-on:reverse=\"$_reversed = evt.detail.value\"\n    data-attr:name=\"$_name\"\n></reverse-component>\n```\n \n\nThe `name` attribute value is bound to the `$_name` signal's value, and an event listener modifies the `$_reversed` signal's value sent in the `reverse` event. The web component observes changes to the `name` attribute and responds by reversing the string and dispatching a `reverse` event containing the resulting value.\n```\n[ 1](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_1)class ReverseComponent extends HTMLElement {\n[ 2](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_2)    static get observedAttributes() {\n[ 3](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_3)        return [\"name\"];\n[ 4](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_4)    }\n[ 5](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_5)\n[ 6](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_6)    attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {\n[ 7](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_7)        const value = [...newValue].toReversed().join(\"\");\n[ 8](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_8)        this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"reverse\", { detail: { value } }));\n[ 9](#d5473e5fc4db5bb1_line_9)    }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define(\"reverse-component\", ReverseComponent);\n```\n[](/examples/todomvc)[](/examples/rocket_copy_button)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

Thought it'd be fun to do so. We take the [already converted](https://github.com/trung-kieen/bad-apple-ascii) frames of video and turn them into a ZSTD compressed Gob file that’s embedded in the server binary. This makes the whole animation about 1.9MB. We then stream the frames to the client and update the contents of a pre tag with the frames. The percentage is updated with the current frame number.\n```\n[ 1](#19fba88959271494_line_1)<label\n[ 2](#19fba88959271494_line_2)    data-signals=\"{_percentage: 0, _contents: 'bad apple frames go here'}\"\n[ 3](#19fba88959271494_line_3)    data-init=\"@get('/examples/bad_apple/updates')\"\n[ 4](#19fba88959271494_line_4)>\n[ 5](#19fba88959271494_line_5)    <span data-text=\"`Percentage: ${$_percentage.toFixed(2)}%`\"></span>\n[ 6](#19fba88959271494_line_6)    <input\n[ 7](#19fba88959271494_line_7)        type=\"range\"\n[ 8](#19fba88959271494_line_8)        min=\"0\"\n[ 9](#19fba88959271494_line_9)        max=\"100\"\n        step=\"0.01\"\n        disabled\n        style=\"cursor: default\"\n        data-attr:value=\"$_percentage\"\n    />\n</label>\n<pre style=\"line-height: 100%\" data-text=\"$_contents\"></pre>\n```\n \n\nThis is using Datastar’s ability to patch signals directly. ***No need to generate HTML elements, as the contents are already bound to existing elements.*** We could also stream down the raster frames using base64 encoded images and update the src of an image tag. Either way works, you would just have to use `data-attr:src` on an image tag. Open your browser dev tool’s inspector tab for the contents of the `pre` tag. You'll see the frames being updated in real-time (in this case 30fps).[](/examples/animations)[](/examples/bulk_update)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

Below are a few examples of various animation techniques.\n## Color Throb [#](#color-throb)\n \n\nThe simplest animation technique in Datastar is to keep the id of an element stable across a content swap. If the id of an element is kept stable, Datastar will swap it in such a way that CSS transitions can be written between the old version of the element and the new one.\n\nConsider this divDemobrown on orange \n\nWith SSE, we just update the style every second\n```\n<div\n    id=\"color-throb\"\n    style=\"color: var(--blue-8); background-color: var(--orange-5);\"\n>\n    blue on orange\n</div>\n```\n \n## View Transitions [#](#view-transitions)\n \n\nThe swapping of the button below is happening on the backend. Each click is causing a transition of state. The animated opacity animation is provided automatically by the View Transition API (not yet supported by Firefox). Doesn’t matter if the targeted elements are different types, it will still “do the right thing”.DemoSwap It! \n## Fade Out On Swap [#](#fade-out-on-swap)\n \n\nIf you want to fade out an element that is going to be removed when the request ends, just send an SSE event with the opacity set to 0 and set a transition duration. This will fade out the element before it is removed.DemoFade out then delete on click \n## Fade In On Addition [#](#fade-in-on-addition)\n \n\nBuilding on the previous example, we can fade in the new content the same way, starting from an opacity of 0 and transitioning to an opacity of 1.DemoFade me in on click[](/examples/active_search)[](/examples/bad_apple)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

First let’s look at the row prior to editing:\n```\n<tr>\n    <td>Joe Smith</td>\n    <td>[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</td>\n    <td>\n        <button data-on:click=\"@get('/examples/edit_row/0')\">\n            Edit\n        </button>\n    </td>\n</tr>\n```\n \n\nThis will trigger a whole table replacement as we are going to remove the edit buttons from other rows as well as change out the inputs to allow editing.\n\nFinally, here is what the row looks like when the data is being edited:\n```\n[ 1](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_1)<tr>\n[ 2](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_2)    <td>\n[ 3](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_3)        <input type=\"text\" data-bind:name>\n[ 4](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_4)    </td>\n[ 5](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_5)    <td>\n[ 6](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_6)        <input type=\"text\" data-bind:email>\n[ 7](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_7)    </td>\n[ 8](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_8)    <td>\n[ 9](#ad2428b964e077d8_line_9)        <button data-on:click=\"@get('/examples/edit_row/cancel')\">\n            Cancel\n        </button>\n        <button data-on:click=\"@patch('/examples/edit_row/0')\">\n            Save\n        </button>\n    </td>\n</tr>\n```\n \n\nHere we have a few things going on, clicking the cancel button will bring back the read-only version of the row. Finally, there is a save button that issues a `PATCH` to update the contact.[](/examples/delete_row)[](/examples/event_bubbling)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

This example implements a simple alert action and attribute.\n### Action [#](#action)\n \n\nAn `action` plugin can be implemented as follows.\n```\naction({\n    name: 'alert',\n    apply(ctx, value) {\n        alert(value)\n    }\n})\n```\n \n\nSetting the `name` to `alert` results in the syntax `@alert`.\n```\n<button data-on:click=\"@alert('Hello from an action')\">\n    Alert using an action\n</button>\n```\n \n### Attribute [#](#attribute)\n \n\nAn `attribute` plugin can be implemented as follows.\n```\n[ 1](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_1)attribute({\n[ 2](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_2)    name: 'alert',\n[ 3](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_3)    requirement: {\n[ 4](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_4)        key: 'denied',\n[ 5](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_5)        value: 'must',\n[ 6](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_6)    },\n[ 7](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_7)    returnsValue: true,\n[ 8](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_8)    apply({ el, rx }) {\n[ 9](#d2be753829b23dc2_line_9)        const callback = () => alert(rx())\n        el.addEventListener('click', callback)\n        return () => el.removeEventListener('click', callback)\n    }\n})\n```\n \n\nSetting the `name` to `alert` results in the syntax `data-alert`.\n\nThe attribute shouldn’t take a key and needs a value, so `key` is `denied` and `value` is a `must`. The attribute expects a value to be returned from the expression so we set `returnsValue` to `true`.\n\nOn `apply`, we create an event listener that alerts the value returned from the expression when the element is clicked. We return a function that removes the event listener on `cleanup`.\n```\n<button data-alert=\"'Hello from an attribute'\">\n    Alert using an attribute\n</button>\n```\n[](/examples/custom_event)[](/examples/dbmon)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

A `data-on:click` attribute on the parent container of the buttons. When any button is clicked, the event bubbles up to the parent, where we can access the clicked button’s `data-id` attribute via `evt.target.dataset.id`. This allows us to handle all button clicks with a single event listener.\n\nNote the `pointer-events: none;` style on the button container. This is to prevent the container from sending click events.[](/examples/edit_row)[](/examples/file_upload)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

In this example, we are listening to a custom event myevent on the foo element. When the event is triggered, the `$_eventDetails` signal is set to the event’s details.\n\nThis is primarily used when interacting with Web Components or other custom elements that emit custom events.\n### Note [#](#note)\n \n\nThere is an extra variable `evt` available in the event handler that contains the event object. This is used to access the event details like `evt.detail` in this example.[](/examples/click_to_load)[](/examples/custom_plugin)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "code_generation"}

We can use this to listen for keydown events and run an expression only when a specific key or key combination is pressed.\n## Goal [#](#goal)\n \n\nOur goal is to show an alert whenever the user presses the `Enter` key, or a combination of the `Ctrl` and `L` keys. Demo\n\nPress `Enter` or `Ctrl + L` \n## Steps [#](#steps)\n \n\nThe `data-on:keydown` attribute will listen for keydown events only on the element on which it is placed, by default. We can listen for events on the `window` element to capture keydown events globally, by adding the `__window` modifier.\n```\n<div data-on:keydown__window=\"alert('Key pressed')\"></div>\n```\n \n\nThis will show an alert whenever the user presses *any* key. To limit the alert to only the `Enter` key, we can use the `evt.key` property to check the key that was pressed. The `evt` variable represents the event object and is always available in the expression.\n```\n<div data-on:keydown__window=\"evt.key === 'Enter' && alert('Key pressed')\"></div>\n```\n \n\nWe can add the `Ctrl` and `L` key combination by checking the `evt.ctrlKey` and `evt.key` properties.\n```\n<div data-on:keydown__window=\"evt.ctrlKey && evt.key === 'l' && alert('Key pressed')\"></div>\n```\n \n\nFinally, we can combine the two expressions to show an alert whenever the user presses the `Enter` key, or the `Ctrl` and `L` keys.\n```\n<div data-on:keydown__window=\"(evt.key === 'Enter' || (evt.ctrlKey && evt.key === 'l')) && alert('Key pressed')\"></div>\n```\n \n\nSometimes, we may want to prevent the default behavior of the keydown event, such as submitting a form when the `Enter` key is pressed. We can do this by calling `evt.preventDefault()`.\n```\n<div data-on:keydown__window=\"evt.key === 'Enter' && (evt.preventDefault(), alert('Key pressed'))\"></div>\n```\n \n## Conclusion [#](#conclusion)\n \n\nThe `evt` variable is always available in [`data-on`](/reference/attributes#data-on) attribute expressions. In the case of the [`keydown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event) event, which is a [`KeyboardEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent), we can perform actions conditionally, based on any of the event’s properties.[]()[](/how_tos/keep_datastar_code_dry)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "howto"}

It is useful when you want to refresh the UI on the frontend, based on real-time data from the backend. \n\nThis in contrast to a push-based mechanism, in which a long-lived SSE connection is kept open between the client and the server, and the server pushes updates to the client whenever necessary. Push-based mechanisms are more efficient than polling, and can be achieved using Datastar, but may be less desirable for some backends.\n\nIn PHP, for example, keeping long-lived SSE connections is fine for a dashboard in which users are authenticated, as the number of connections are limited. For a public-facing website, however, it is not recommended to open many long-lived connections, due to the architecture of most PHP servers.\n## Goal [#](#goal)\n \n\nOur goal is to poll the backend at regular intervals (starting at 5 second intervals) and update the UI accordingly. The backend will determine changes to the DOM and be able to control the rate at which the frontend polls based on some criteria. For this example, we will simply output the server time, increasing the polling frequency to 1 second during the last 10 seconds of every minute. The criteria could of course be anything such as the number of times previously polled, the user’s role, load on the server, etc.Demo\n\n \n## Steps [#](#steps)\n \n\nThe `data-on-interval` attribute allows us to run an expression at a regular interval. We’ll use it to send a `GET` request to the backend, and use the `__duration` modifier to set the interval duration.\n```\n<div id=\"time\"\n     data-on-interval__duration.5s=\"@get('/endpoint')\"\n></div>\n```\n \n\nIn addition to the interval, we could also run the expression immediately by adding `.leading` to the modifier.\n```\n<div id=\"time\"\n     data-on-interval__duration.5s.leading=\"@get('/endpoint')\"\n></div>\n```\n \n\nMost of the time, however, we’d just render the current time on page load using a backend templating language.\n```\n<div id=\"time\"\n     data-on-interval__duration.5s=\"@get('/endpoint')\"\n>\n     {{ now }}\n</div>\n```\n \n\nNow our backend can respond to each request with a [`datastar-patch-elements`](/reference/sse_events#datastar-patch-elements) event with an updated version of the element.\n```\nevent: datastar-patch-elements\ndata: elements <div id=\"time\" data-on-interval__duration.5s=\"@get('/endpoint')\">\ndata: elements     {{ now }}\ndata: elements </div>\n\n\n```\n \n\nBe careful not to add `.leading` to the modifier in the response, as it will cause the frontend to immediately send another request.\n\nHere’s how it", "category": "howto"}

One commonly used example concerns preventing the repetition of a backend action.\n```\n<button data-on:click=\"@get('/endpoint')\">Click me</button>\n<button data-on:click=\"@get('/endpoint')\">No, click me!</button>\n<button data-on:click=\"@get('/endpoint')\">Click us all!</button>\n```\n \n\nThe common misconception is that Datastar should provide shorthand syntax for the repeated `@get` action. The answer is that this should be solved using your templating language. For example:\n```\n{% set action = \"@get('/endpoint')\" %}\n<button data-on:click=\"{{ action }}\">Click me</button>\n<button data-on:click=\"{{ action }}\">No, click me!</button>\n<button data-on:click=\"{{ action }}\">Click us all!</button>\n```\n \n\nAlternatively, using a loop:\n```\n{% set labels = ['Click me', 'No, click me!', 'Click us all!'] %}\n{% for label in labels %}\n    <button data-on:click=\"@get('/endpoint')\">{{ label }}</button>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n \n\nThanks to [event bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Event_bubbling), a single event listener can be attached to a parent element instead of each button:\n```\n<div data-on:click=\"evt.target.tagName == 'BUTTON' \n    && @get('/endpoint')\n\">\n    <button>Click me</button>\n    <button>No, click me!</button>\n    <button>Click us all!</button>\n</div>\n```\n \n\nThis is the pattern that both the [Blinksy](https://play.putyourlightson.com/blinksy) and [Checkboxes](https://checkboxes.andersmurphy.com/) demos use to prevent registering multiple event listeners for the same action, while being able to send a corresponding ID for each button clicked.\n```\n<div data-on:click=\"evt.target.tagName == 'BUTTON' \n    && ($id = evt.target.dataset.id)\n    && @get('/endpoint')\n\">\n    <button data-id=\"1\">Click me</button>\n    <button data-id=\"2\">No, click me!</button>\n    <button data-id=\"3\">Click us all!</button>\n</div>\n```\n Click me No, click me!

This is to save resources on both the client and server.\n\nTo keep the connection open even when the page is hidden, you can set the [`openWhenHidden`](/reference/actions#openWhenHidden) option to `true`.\n```\n<button data-on:click=\"@get('/endpoint', {openWhenHidden: true})\"></button>\n```\n \n### CQRS Pattern [#](#cqrs-pattern)\n \n\nWhen using the [CQRS pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), it’s best to design event streams with interruptions in mind, since they can occur for many reasons beyond just tab switching. The simplest way to ensure resilience is to use a “fat morph” approach: send the complete desired state of the main content area with each update instead of incremental changes like append, which are much more vulnerable to interruptions.\n\nHere’s a simple example of a CQRS approach in which the main content area is always kept up to date. This way, you can leave `openWhenHidden` as is, and if the SSE connection is interrupted for any reason, the next event will contain the complete and correct state of the main content area.\n```\n<div data-init=\"@get('/cqrs_endpoint')\"></div>\n<div id=\"main\">\n    ...\n</div>\n```\n[](/how_tos/poll_the_backend_at_regular_intervals)[](/how_tos/redirect_the_page_from_the_backend)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "howto"}

Here’s what has changed, who Pro is for, and how to achieve some of the same things with the free version.\n## The facts [#](#the-facts)\n \n\nDatastar remains MIT-licensed and free. For v1, we moved a handful of convenience plugins into [Datastar Pro](/datastar_pro). The old code is tagged in the repo. Fork if you want. \n\nThe same outcomes are possible with the freely available version using standard APIs. We use the same API that everyone else does. Nothing you can build was taken from you; we set a support boundary. Judge the work by results: smaller bundles, faster apps, and lower egress and compute.\n\nHere’s how you can replicate two Pro attributes using the free version:\n```\n<!-- Replaces the current URL on load and whenever $page changes. -->\n<div data-effect=\"window.history.replaceState({}, '', '/page/' + $page)\"></div>\n\n<!-- Scrolls the element into view. -->\n<div data-init=\"el.scrollIntoView()\"></div>\n```\n \n## Timeline and philosophy [#](#timeline-and-philosophy)\n \n- Datastar was available under the MIT license since the beginning.\n- Mostly a solo project until Ben, and later Johnny, joined.\n- We rewrote the code from scratch at least three times to achieve a rock-solid foundation that will last many years. No Datastar v2 is planned or necessary.\n- Started life as a tiny ~3 KB core with docs on writing plugins.\n- It still is plugin-first. The v1 line defines what we will support long-term.\n## Who is Pro for? [#](#who-is-pro-for?)\n \n\nHobbyist, student, solo tinkerer? Keep using the free core. You don’t need Pro to build real apps. Pro makes sense if:\n- The [Datastar Inspector](/datastar_pro#datastar-inspector) will save you time.\n- You want the convenience that the [Pro plugins](/datastar_pro#pro-features) provide, even if we don’t think you *need* them.\n- You want to support the project and prefer to purchase over donating (donations are tax deductible in the US).\n- You don’t want to write or maintain plugins yourself.\n\nPro is a one-time lifetime license purchased from 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We don’t hold shares nor own equity. We steward the project. There is no buyout and no rug pull.\n## Why one bundle [#](#why-one-bundle)\n \n\nWe are pricing plugins, [Inspector](/datastar_pro#datastar-inspector), [Rocket](/datastar_pro#rocket), and [Stellar CSS](/datastar_pro#stellar-css) together. One price keeps things simple and avoids FOMO. You pay once and get everything we ship under Pro, now and forever. No nickel-and-diming, no price matrix, no guessing what we might hold back.

Even with all the plugins included it hovers between 10-12Kb minified+gzipped. One of the things that you might not know is how much of that is actually “external” dependencies.\n\nIt accounts for over half of the size is actually the dependencies; let’s break it down:DependencyUsage **[ts-merge-patch](https://github.com/riagominota/ts-merge-patch)**is used by the core to merge the signalss while matching RPC7396 for JSON Merge Patch.**[json-bigint](https://github.com/Ivan-Korolenko/json-with-bigint)**native JSON.parse/stringify don’t support BigInts, this is a polyfill, hopefully some day its native.**[preact-core](https://github.com/preactjs/signals)**Fine grained reactivity, used by the core to update the views.**[deep-signal](https://github.com/EthanStandel/deepsignal)**Forms the basis of the reactive signals.**[idiomorph](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph)**Morph incoming HTML fragments into existing DOM, by same author as [htmx](https://htmx.org/). [1](#fn:1)**[fetch-event-source](https://github.com/Azure/fetch-event-source)**Microsoft’s take of using `text/event-stream` without EventSource API\n\nThese are all tiny and are probably better than anything I write myself. Also, they aren’t included externally but live in the `/library/src/external` folder. This is because some weren’t TypeScript and formatting wasn’t consistent. It also makes it easier to debug and step through the code, while still getting tree-shaking out of the box. The only downside is any updates are manual, but that’s a small price to pay for the benefits.\n\nThe latest dependency is [fetch-event-source](https://github.com/Azure/fetch-event-source). Since the EventSource API doesn’t support non-GET requests and some other limitations, originally I thought I was clever and made my own implementation within the backend plugin. However, it was a bit of a mess when it came to error handling and reconnection and come to find out the Azure team had already done the majority of work. This library is a much better implementation.\n\nI want to keep Datastar as small as possible, so I’m always on the lookout for better alternatives or ways to reduce the size.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please let me know!\n- It’s also funny that Datastar is the only project I’m aware of that uses Idiomorph as it’s merge strategy, even though it’s by the same author as htmx. I guess it’s a bit of a hidden gem. It takes about 1⁄4 of Datastar’s total size, but it is a very powerful tool that I don’t see myself replacing anytime soon.[](/essays/htmx_sucks)[](/essays/event_streams_all_the_way_down)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "architecture"}

Seneca\n\nHoly 💩 it is finally done. Last time we talked about the road to V1, what I didn’t tell you is that on the drive up to give that talk I was honestly struck by a bit of despair. I came very close to just deleting the site and docs and just keeping the source up out of convenience, without promoting it anymore. I was fighting with everyone on almost every topic. Something had to give. I was 💯 convinced the right way forward for the hypermedia-first framework. Here are the highlights and where we are today.\n- Rewrite in TypeScript. This has been [covered](/essays/why_another_framework) [previously](https://data-star.dev/essays/why_another_framework). Even more so than when I wrote the original essay I feel vindicated by this choice. The htmx community was extremely bearish on TS and yet for me the ability to do static analysis meant less runtime checking. I think the fact we are ~40% smaller than htmx (when you include morphing) with so many more features proves this out. It seems like they’re conflating building the framework in TS with the need for TS in user applications.\n- Make everything a plugin. Extensions do not cut it. Other than signals, literally everything else is a plugin. Datastar takes [data-*](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes) key-value pairs and parses them into parts and makes them reactive. That’s it. The core is less than 250 lines of code, and while terse, it is pretty straightforward. Pick what you want, leave the rest. We are probably best known for our take on SSE but that’s really just my opinion showing through. There is literally nothing stopping you from porting htmx or Alpine.js to Datastar: the inverse is not the case.\n- Signals are table stakes. I’m glad they are now a known thing in the frontend community. By being smart with how we create expressions we have access to the fastest known approach (confirmed by the mad genius behind [alien signals](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals)). \n- No vendored core. This is something I really wanted, but didn’t have the stomach for. Luckily since then I’ve gotten the support to tackle this. We have a purpose-built implementation for every line of code now. No deps, no libraries… just solve our case and not be forced to conform to other library constraints. In doing so we’ve not only shrunk the code, but added features and will take on anybody’s metrics in real-world applications.\n- No SDK needed. When Datastar was on the front page of Hacker News, the only real arguments I got from the wider hypermedia advocates was the reliance on SSE. While I think the whole need for an SDK is completely overblown (it’s two events, people!), it’s clear that it was an issue for others. Now we have direct support for HTML, JSON, and JavaScript for simple cases. This means caching and static site", "category": "architecture"}

Lack of builds might be the right choice for htmx but in my eyes it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The author is concurrently wary of progress yet works on a library about extending the HTML spec to do more than it was designed for. The essay is written by a core contributor and not the author of htmx. In general, it’s filled with so many fallacies but the real culprit is the *false dilemma fallacy*.\n> \n\nThis common fallacy misleads by presenting complex issues in terms of two inherently opposed sides. Instead of acknowledging that most (if not all) issues can be thought of on a spectrum of possibilities and stances, the false dilemma fallacy asserts that there are only two mutually exclusive outcomes. This fallacy is particularly problematic because it can lend false credence to extreme stances, ignoring opportunities for compromise or chances to re-frame the issue in a new way.\n\nThe whole discussion is framed as a false dilemma. Almost every point he makes is demonstrably false by the counter example of Datastar. Its smaller, faster, supports more features, isn’t written in JavaScript, targets multiple browser versions, and has a build step. If he is trying to prove his point it needs to be done with more rigor. In general I find the htmx essays to be a beacon for well articulated arguments; this one is not and does a disservice to the community exploring hypermedia.\n## TED Talk [#](#ted-talk)\n \n\nIn the first paragraph he says both:\n> \n\nA recurring question from some htmx contributors is why htmx isn’t written in TypeScript, or, for that matter, why htmx ***lacks any build step at all***. The full htmx source is a single 3,500-line JavaScript file; if you want to contribute to htmx, you do so by modifying the htmx.js file, the same file that gets sent to browsers in production, ***give or take minification and compression***.\n\nSo before the essay starts he’s given up the ghost. Even in as close to pure JavaScript as you can get you still need a build step. Thank you, this has been my TED talk.\n## Write once, run forever [#](#write-once,-run-forever)\n \n> \n\nThe best reason to write a library in plain JavaScript is that it lasts forever.\n\nThis is just not the world we live in. ES5 is dead, IE11 is dead, ECMAScript doesn’t look anything like it did a decade ago, let alone 20 years ago. ECMAScript has been around for 25 years and has changed a lot in that time, let alone the APIs you are interfacing with. The web is a moving target and you need to keep up with it. If you don’t you will be left behind.\n## Reduction in labor [#](#reduction-in-labor)\n \n> \n\nMaintenance is a cost paid for with labor, and open-source code bases are the projects that can least afford to pay it. Opting not to use a build step drastically minimizes the labor required to keep htmx up-to-date.\n\nNo, just no.

Apparently I hold the minority opinion that if\n- Are using HTTP as your UI interface\n- Humans are using your UI\n- You are using [HOWL](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/)\n- Have complete control over the backend\n\nThen you should only ***ever*** be usings either the 2xx or 3xx series of status codes. The 4xx and 5xx series are for machines and should never be seen by humans. The 4xx series is for client errors and the 5xx series is for server errors. If you are using HTTP as your UI interface then you should be handling all errors on the client side. If you are using a 4xx or 5xx series code then you are doing something wrong.\n\n[This](https://discord.com/channels/725789699527933952/1156332851093065788/1156377394530242622) section is the most relevant:\n> \n\n**@alex** — What if the user enters a URL they don’t have access to?\n\n**@delaneyj** — then you redirect them or create a you aren’t allowed page no?\n\n**@Deniz A.

If you are using HTTP as your UI interface then you should be using the 2xx and 3xx series of status codes. If you are using the 4xx or 5xx series then you are doing something wrong.\n## Hypermedia is for humans [#](#hypermedia-is-for-humans)\n \n\nThe whole point of [HOWL](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/) is to make your UI driven by HATEOAS and users do not care about the underlying protocol. Redirecting a users or explaining why they aren’t authorized then it should be done in the UI. If you need to expose an API there are far more efficient and explicit ways to do that such as [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [dRPC](https://docs.drpc.org/), or [Buf’s Connect](https://buf.build/blog/connect-a-better-grpc).

[#](#what-does-datastar-do?)\n \n\nIf it’s a 3xx we redirect, 2xx we merge the HTML fragment, and anything else throws an error. I’m considering even forcing a `window.alert` on top of throwing the error. If you get at client error or server error ***when you control both sides*** then it’s a bug, and you should be fixing it.\n\n[](/essays/event_streams_all_the_way_down)[](/essays/grugs_around_the_fire)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "architecture"}

Use Datastar.\n\nIt’s been a long time since I wrote an essay on the site. Part of the reason is that the project overall was done in my head, and was “good enough” for my needs. A while back, Carson Gross prompted me to give a talk at [Utah.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K71AyAF6E4&t=8s&pp=ygUPdXRhaC5qcyBkZWxhbmV5), and I later appeared as a guest on the [HX-Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbTFlUqELVc&t=36s&pp=ygUcaHgtcG9kIGRlbGFuZXkgaHRteCBnaWxsaWxhbg%3D%3D) to talk about why everyone has been doing web development wrong – especially me. I put out a call for help before calling it V1, and man, the response was overwhelming.\n\nThat was all before the PHP nation attacked.\n\nThere have been people who come in with their own itch and want changes to Datastar, which makes perfect sense. But all of a sudden, I’m getting PHP devs really interested, including an early contributor to htmx. I don’t think of PHP as a real-time language, so if Datastar works for their needs as well as my real-time focused project, I must be doing something right.\n\nIt’s been a maelstrom of activity over the last month or so. The entire codebase has been rewritten twice. That might seem silly, but it’s all about the assumptions you’re making. It’s no surprise that I dislike TypeScript and loathe JavaScript, but they are the only game in town (WASM doesn’t count yet). Through the rewrites, I’ve gone from a prisoner of the constraints to trying to thrive in them. It’s a very weird feeling, but I’m actually proud of the codebase now. Looking at it, it seems obvious in a way that only hindsight can provide.\n\nSome of the highlights of the changes since the last essay:\n- The core `engine.ts` is now 266 lines, including more checks and features than before. It’s not built to be code golf but to be readable and maintainable.\n- The ES6 module was 17.14KiB, and it’s currently 12KiB. That’s over 30% smaller, with more features and more checks. Some of this is due to not using giant strings for errors, but a lot is down to better type checking and handling. My original thesis was that TypeScript would make the codebase smaller and more maintainable. I was right – it’s made a huge difference.\n- We’ve removed all the magic. Prior iterations had `$` and `$$` functions that would do magic things. Everything is explicit now. It’s a little more verbose, but it’s a lot more maintainable. Maybe it’s because I’m a Go developer, but I’ll take some verbosity for long-term readability and maintainability.\n- There are extensions available to require less typing while still being explicit. I’ll probably do a whole essay on just function constructors and the meta-magic you have to do to make them work.\n- Official SDKs. One of the flaws in my initial getting started guide was that I wanted to show there is no magic. You start from a raw HTTP response and built up to using Datastar. While valuable, it’s intimidating. Now there are SDKs for the major languages that will get you up and running in minutes. You learn the “Datastar way” and can transfer to other languages easily.\n- C", "category": "architecture"}

[#](#what’s-different?)\n \n\nThere are many things I find wonderful about Alpine.js and htmx. However, there are a few things that I think could be improved. The biggest challenge it both is plugins (called `directives`/`magic` in Alpine and `extensions` in htmx). I tried writing in both of them and was disappointed by the breadth of monkey patching and lack of type safety. In general, you don’t have access to what other plugins do nor can you build a DAG of dependencies (i.e. you can’t structure the dependencies in a way that they flow in one direction without looping back on themselves). This means you have to be very careful about the order in which you load plugins and what they do. This is especially true if you want to use a plugin in a plugin. I think this is a big problem and I wanted to solve it. Because Datastar started with the notion that ***EVERYTHING*** is a plugin, you could theoretically build both Alpine and htmx inside Datastar. I don’t think that is a good idea, but it is possible.\n\nBeyond that, I want the backend to be the *source of truth* when it comes to state. [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) is a great way to structure your applications, but you still need some client side state. Datastar does not use FormData; it lacks the ability to define nested data structures simply. So in general you send up JSON (automatically) and down HTML. This is more prescriptive than htmx, but again this is with just the included plugins. You can build your own plugins to do whatever you want.\n## Background [#](#background)\n \n\nI love what [Caleb Porzio](https://calebporzio.com/) has done with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and what [Carson Gross](https://bigsky.software/cv/) has done with [htmx](https://htmx.org/). However, after trying to make extensions in both I became disappointed with the limitations. Both are pure JavaScript, which is fine but leads to having to either having to keep the whole state in your head and/or being prepared for lots of runtime errors. Personally I think the best way to do this is to use Typescript and have the build step and compiler catch as many errors as possible. Plus it makes it easier to extend and create optimized builds.\n### Why not just use Vue/React/Svelte? [#](#why-not-just-use-vue/react/svelte?)\n \n\n[htmx Essays](https://htmx.org/essays/) are a great place to start.\n### Why not just use htmx + Alpine? [#](#why-not-just-use-htmx-+-alpine?)\n \n\nThere was a bit of a rant here before. TL;DR I tried to show htmx v2 could do all these things, and it wasn’t accepted by the community. I think htmx is great and I will continue to recommend it. In general, I think that some of the choices are throwing the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to things like Vite/TS/etc. The good news is that everything I and some other lurkers wanted is available in Datastar or can be added easily via plugins.[](/essays/yes_you_want_a_build_step)[]()[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "architecture"}

With a single request you can create a server driven stream of events. Using this for driving Datastar’s [htmx](https://htmx.org/) like fragments plugin is a natural fit. The only problem is that SSE doesn’t support anything but the `GET` method. This means that you can’t use SSE to send data to the server. This is a problem for htmx, because htmx uses the `POST` method to send data to the server. So, what to do?\n## The Solution [#](#the-solution)\n \n\n`text/event-stream` MIME type is the underlying protocol for [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events). It is a simple protocol that is easy to implement. It is also a simple protocol to extend. So, we can extend it to support `POST`,`PUT`,`PATCH`,`DELETE` requests. The majority of the code is in how your read and buffer results from [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) calls. The rest is just a matter of parsing the request and sending the appropriate response. The great part is the server side still just uses the same libraries or helpers that it would use for SSE.\n\nThis means every data fragment is an OOB in htmx terms.\n\nThis is easy to debug, easy to create, and still makes use of middlewares like compression. It’s just HTML fragments but wrapped in a protocol that allows for streaming and server driven events.[](/essays/another_dependency)[](/essays/im_a_teapot)[](/star_federation)[](https://www.arcustech.com/)", "category": "architecture"}

{"instruction": "What is Datastar?", "output": "Datastar is a lightweight (10.7KB) JavaScript framework for building reactive hypermedia-driven web applications. It combines the backend-driven approach of HTMX with Alpine.js-style frontend reactivity using data-* attributes. Key concepts: signals for reactive state, SSE (Server-Sent Events) for backend communication, and HTML-first declarative syntax.", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "How does Datastar compare to HTMX?", "output": "Datastar is similar to HTMX in using HTML attributes for backend-driven updates, but differs in several ways:\n1. Built-in reactivity via signals (no need for Alpine.js)\n2. Uses SSE instead of AJAX for backend communication\n3. Smaller bundle size (~10.7KB vs HTMX's ~14KB)\n4. Unified data-* attribute syntax\n5. First-class support for fine-grained DOM updates via merge-fragments\n6. Built-in expression evaluation in attributes", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "How do I install Datastar?", "output": "Add Datastar via CDN:\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@starfederation/datastar\"></script>\n```\nOr install via npm:\n```bash\nnpm install @starfederation/datastar\n```\nThen import:\n```javascript\nimport '@starfederation/datastar'\n```", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "What are signals in Datastar?", "output": "Signals are Datastar's reactive state mechanism. Define them with `data-signals`:\n```html\n<div data-signals-count=\"0\">\n  <button data-on-click=\"$count++\">Count: <span data-text=\"$count\"></span></button>\n</div>\n```\nSignals use snake_case naming. Access signals with `$` prefix in expressions. Signals are reactive - when their value changes, all dependent elements automatically update.", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "How do I make a backend request in Datastar?", "output": "Use `data-on-click=\"@get('/endpoint')\"` or `@post`, `@put`, `@patch`, `@delete`:\n```html\n<button data-on-click=\"@get('/api/data')\">Load</button>\n```\nThe backend responds with SSE events like `datastar-merge-fragments` to update the DOM:\n```\nevent: datastar-merge-fragments\ndata: fragments <div id=\"result\">Updated!</div>\n\n\n```", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "How do I bind form inputs in Datastar?", "output": "Use `data-bind` to two-way bind an input to a signal:\n```html\n<div data-signals-name=\"''\">\n  <input data-bind-name />\n  <p>Hello, <span data-text=\"$name\"></span>!</p>\n</div>\n```\nThe signal updates as the user types, and the span reactively displays the current value.", "category": "synthetic"}
{"instruction": "What SSE events does Datastar support?", "output": "Datastar uses these SSE events:\n- `datastar-merge-fragments` — merge HTML into the DOM (with merge modes: morph, inner, outer, prepend, append, before, after, upsert_attributes, delete)\n- `datastar-merge-signals` — update signal values\n- `datastar-remove-fragments` — remove elements by CSS selector\n- `datastar-remove-signals` — remove signals by path\n- `datastar-execute-script` — run JavaScript", "category": "synthetic"}

{"instruction": "What are common Datastar gotchas?", "output": "Common gotchas:\n1. Signal names MUST be snake_case (camelCase won't work)\n2. Use `$` prefix to access signals in expressions: `$my_signal` not `my_signal`\n3. String signal values need nested quotes: `data-signals-name=\"'default'\"`\n4. SSE events need double newline terminator\n5. `data-on-load` runs once on element mount, use `@get` for backend calls\n6. Sibling elements share signals via closest common ancestor with `data-signals`\n7. Use `data-signals` (plural) for initialization, `$signal` for access", "category": "synthetic"}
